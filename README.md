Node.js script for creating artificial randomized vote in online polls. (For educational purposes only.)

Requires Tor to be installed and running, and socks5-http-client.

Essentially, you'll need to run these commands:

npm install socks5-http-client  
brew install tor  
tor  
node run.js  

This is for educational purposes only, so you can't blame me for any unethical behavior you partake in.
